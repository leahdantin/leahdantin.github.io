    About Leah
</h2>
Hi! If you didn't already know, my name is Leah Dantin, and I am a Senior at
Ponte Vedra High School, in North East Florida. I personally coded this website from what I learned in school by being in the IT Academy. Everything presented is true to me and thank you!
<br />
<p>

    &emsp;&#8226; I interned at Citibank this past summer for six weeks.
     I worked in the Branded Cards Analyst Group using Agile and Scrum techniques.
     It taught me communication skills, office ettiquette, and time management.
     <br />
    &emsp;&#8226;At Citibank, I was chosen with 15 other high school girls for their
     Women in IT program. As a side project, in addition to our normal workload,
     we created Amazon Alexa skills. We learned Java Script and competed with one another.
     <br />
    &emsp;&#8226; I am well traveled; I have visited 39 states and over 20 countries. Therefore,
    I am well cultured and I believe that it is vital for a global market. Also, I am currently enrolled
    in Dual Enrollment Spanish, with a high A first semester, so I may be fluent before my first job. I also previously took
    AP Spanish Language last year and received an A.
    <br />
    &emsp;&#8226; I am certified in Microsoft Excel 2016, and that is crucial in the accounting world.
    <br />
    &emsp;&#8226; I am a CIW Web Developer, which includes both the use of CSS and HTML.
    <br />
    &emsp;&#8226;Myers-Brigs test: ISTJ and ESTJ, My extrovertedness changes sometimes, but they're almost always congruent.
